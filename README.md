## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

### Project Outline

My plan for this project was to build the visuals first, then work on the functionality of the calculator. Focusing on the design (Which I was working from a design file) helped make the project seem more manageable, primarily because I was able to see the progress early on.

### Built With

### What I Learned

There are pros and cons to doing the visuals first, and that decided which to do first is an important decision in the planing process.
